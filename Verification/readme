//Don't ask me why. (For God damn sake to save your time :)

First, you should download and intall PBC library at 
"https://crypto.stanford.edu/pbc/manual.html#_installing_pbc"
(99.99% that you will meet some errors during installing, you need to install
a few dependecy tool, don't be hesitate, install them till no errors appear)

Then, go to the directory "/yourlocalpath/pbc-0.5.14/example" and 
switch the original "bls.c" with my "bls.c" file.
 
About the code:
1. All the code you need is in bls.c, the only file you need to look at!
2. Other *.c fils do not server the verification of this project, 
their role is to make bls.c compile successfully.
3  Use 'make' to compile, debug the code if any errors appear
4. Good luck !
