This is the deep learning part.

I simplified DNN model example provided Tensorlow team.
The simple model only has two full connection layer, no drop out, no CNNs.


There are two optimizer of the simple model.

First optimizer is the original one implemented by Tensorflow team
You can get gradients and updated parameters by this optimizer, it also supports regularization

Second optimizer is followed by the chain rule to calculate the each intermediate results to get
the gradient. It does not support regularization, but it can provide the error signal term at each layer.
